# Full Stack Project Practice

Be prepared to discuss these items with a consultant during a 1 on 1.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

```md
My idea is a resource for cool house plants. I came up with it brainstorming and going through things like pinterests for inpiration. I think that a lot of people enjoy the idea and practice of adding a piece of nature into their homes. Users would be people who want to begin keeping a log of plants of interest and costs. Perhaps some fun facts about the plan as well.
I also find in conversations about plants with other people I learn something new. That piece was important to me because I wanted certain users to feel like they had something to offer of value as well when adding to their resource.
```

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

```md
I will need a table with columns for multiple plant varieties.

```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another
(one to many, many to many, etc).

Include an image (or a link to image) below.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

```md
I plan to utilize the schedule.md as well as dedicate most of my free time over the weekend if not all of it to completing project to schedule.
```
